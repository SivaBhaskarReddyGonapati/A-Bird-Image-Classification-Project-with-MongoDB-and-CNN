## Bird Image Classification Project With MongoDB and CNN

# Overview:
This project focuses on creating a Bird Image Classification system using MongoDB and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to classify bird species based on images. The dataset comprises images of various bird species, and the trained model can predict the species of a given bird image.

* Scikit-learn.

# Setup:
1. Notebook
a. Download the provided python notebook.
2. Start MongoDB:
a. MongoDB
3. Connect to MongoDB Compass using version 1.40.4.
4. Run the python notebook in any Python environment. 

# Data Collection and Storage:
Bird images are stored in MongoDB using GridFS. The upload_data() function uploads images from a local directory to the MongoDB database.

# Data Preprocessing:
Images are loaded from MongoDB, resized, and flattened. Categorical labels are mapped to numerical values, and the dataset is split into training and testing sets.

# Model Architecture:
The CNN model is designed using TensorFlow and Keras. The architecture includes convolutional layers, flattening, and dense layers. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross entropy loss.

# Training the Model:
The model is trained using the training dataset. The training process is visualized and monitored for accuracy and loss.

# Model Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using a test dataset. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and loss are analyzed.

# Predictions:
The trained model is used for making predictions on new bird images. 

# Usage:
To use the project, follow the steps in the Setup section. You can train the model, evaluate its performance, and predict using the provided steps.
